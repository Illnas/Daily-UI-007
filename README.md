Daily UI 007


One of the worst projects that I have done so far! Not only did I struggle with grids,
but I also had problem adapting them to mobile approach. I did realise my problem from the moment
I started using Bootstrap, and that was that I am not yet proficient with HTML/CSS.
So, from now on, I am using CSS only for JS projects and SASS for Daily UI.

And reason for using SASS, is that it's CSS converted for easier usage, but it's still CSS.
With Bootstrap I was using classes that had CSS properties already defined, and most of the time I was
on browser's dev tools inspecting what I did.

Well, we now know what we were doing wrong, and we have a way how to improve it. So, let's start!

See ya in next project!
